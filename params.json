We pick a topic for the month, and, much like study group, we help each other learn a bit more of the topic at hand.\r\n\r\n## How It Works\r\nEach month, the members of Codeclub will pick a topic for dedicated study.  The topic may be a language, a framework, design concepts, really anything that fits under the following general guidelines:\r\n\r\n* The topic should ideally be one that the members have have relatively little experience in working with, but have heard of before (Google's Go Language, Clojure, R, Meteor framework, etc.)\r\n* The topic should be something that, if learned, would be generally useful to the members' profession.\r\n* Highly dependent, but in general, the topic should be something that is open source, so all may easily take part in learning it.\r\n\r\n## How Do We Pick New Topics\r\nBefore the month is out, we will make a VoteIt (www.voteit.com) vote to decide what the next topic of the month will be. \r\n\r\nVotes will last one week, contain no more than 10 options.  Please read the topic guidelines before adding an option.\r\n\r\nThe overall majority will rule this vote, with ties being settled by myself, Joe Ellis, on the basis on which option best fits the topic guidelines. \r\n\r\nAlso, it is completely ok for next month's topic to be a repeat of the current month if that's what wins the vote.\r\n\r\n## The Culture\r\nCodeclub has should have a culture about it that meets the following parameters:\r\n\r\n* Members should keep conversation to the topic at hand. This is one of the main reasons the club exists. I'm sure your off-topic conversation is super interesting, but there are many, many areas at Nola Hack Night to talk about other things, so no need to do it at Codeclub.\r\n* Members should feel free to ask and answer questions.  This should be a place to put your ego aside and just learn.  Don't look down on others because they may not know something you do. \r\n* Share what you learn.  There will be a space in this repo for a given month for folks to share learning resources, links, tips, etc. of the topic at hand.  Let's actively use this resource.\r\n* In general, members should be nice or leave.  Codeclub should be a place of active learning, not a place of arguing.  If you want to argue, that's fine, and I really hope you win;  but take it outside.\r\n\r\nMembers who are constantly breaking conduct rules will be told in the most sincerest of manners to GTFO.\r\n\r\n## Where / When Is It?\r\n\r\nWherever we hold Nola Hack Night, which is currently at Launchpad on Tuesdays from 7pm to whenever.  Nola Hack Night will start at 7:30 to give folks time to arrive and be held in the back conference room.  If the room gets filled, we will open up the side doors and use the family room (the place with the TV and couches).\r\n\r\n\r\n## FAQ\r\n\r\n##### Are there any teachers for the given topic of the month?\r\nNo, we do not make specific plans to have teachers, so assume most of the time, your study should be self-guided.  However, it's a study group, so you should feel free to ask other people for help if you don't understand something.  \r\n\r\n##### I know a lot about your monthly topic, can I come by and teach?\r\nYes, if you'd like to come by and help give us a head start, it will always be greatly appreciated!\r\n\r\n\r\n##### What if I don't like the topic of the month?\r\nThen you probably should not attend Codeclub meetings that month.  It's, of course, impossible to please everyone all the time, so instead of trying to do that, rotating the topic monthly should be frequent enough that eventually there should be a topic you'd be interested in.  I'd\r\n\r\n\r\n##### Can I make suggestions for the group?\r\nAbsolutely, just send a pull request to this README, and we'll start a conversation about your idea (if you don't know how to do this, contact me directly at joe@joeellis.la).  In general, decisions are done in a democratic process, so new ideas will be added assuming its what the group wants.\r\n\r\n\r\n##### How do I join?\r\nThere is no formal membership, just show up!  Everyone is welcome (assuming they stick to the few rules we do have!)","name":"Codeclub"}
