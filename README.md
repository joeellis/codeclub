## What's Codeclub?

Codeclub is a new part of Nola Hack Night for folks looking to learn more about tech that they rarely have a chance to work with.  We pick a tech oriented topic for the month, check our egos at the door, and, much like study group, we collaboratively help each other learn a bit more about that tech.  

## How It Works
Each month, the members of Codeclub will pick a topic for dedicated study.  The topic may be a language, a framework, design concepts, really anything that fits under the following general guidelines:

* The monthly topic should ideally be one that the members have have relatively little experience in working with, but have heard of before (Google's Go Language, Clojure, R, Meteor framework, etc.)
* The monthly topic should provide some sort of general utility to our own professions.
* Highly dependent, but in general, the topic should be something that is open source, so all may easily take part in learning it.

We hold Codeclub in a slightly cordoned off area to cut out distractions and help improve focus to the topic at hand.


## How Do We Pick New Topics
Before the month is out, we will make a VoteIt (www.voteit.com) vote to decide what the next topic of the month will be. 

Votes will last one week, contain no more than 10 options.  Please read the topic guidelines before adding your own option to make sure it qualifies.

The overall majority will rule this vote, with ties being settled by myself, Joe Ellis, on the basis on which option best fits the topic guidelines. 

Also, it is completely ok for next month's topic to be a repeat of the current month if that's what wins the vote.

## The Culture
Codeclub should have a culture that meets the following parameters:

* Codeclub is for learning. Ask questions. Help others. Participants are there to teach themselves and each other so that we can all grow.
* Codeclub is not for big debates or arguments. There are people trying to learn stuff over here!
* Codeclub should be accessible. It is for the n00bs of the monthly topic.  If you already know a fair amount about the topic, help us learn the basics!
* Don't forget to share! Share all the time! There will be a space in this repo for a given month for folks to share learning resources, links, tips, etc. of the topic at hand. So when you leave Hack Night, keep on sharing!

## Where / When Is It?

Wherever we hold Nola Hack Night, which is currently at Launchpad on Tuesdays from 7pm to whenever.  Nola Hack Night will start at 7:30 to give folks time to arrive and be held in the back conference room.  If the room gets filled, we will open up the side doors and use the family room (the place with the TV and couches).  Codeclub will officially end at 9pm, although you're welcome to stay and continue on if you're on a roll.


## FAQ

##### Are there any teachers for the given topic of the month?
No, we do not make specific plans to have teachers, so assume most of the time, your study should be self-guided.  However, it's a study group, so you should feel free to ask other people for help if you don't understand something.  

##### I know a lot about your monthly topic, can I come by and teach?
Yes, if you'd like to come by and help give us a head start, it will always be greatly appreciated!


##### What if I don't like the topic of the month?
Then you probably should not attend Codeclub meetings that month.  It's, of course, impossible to please everyone all the time, so instead of trying to do that, we rotate the topic monthly, which hopefully is frequent enough that eventually we'll have a topic you'd be interested in. 


##### Can I make suggestions for the group?
Absolutely, just send a pull request to this README, and we'll start a conversation about your idea (if you don't know how to do this, contact me directly at joe@joeellis.la).  In general, decisions are done in a democratic process, so new ideas will be added assuming its what the group wants.


##### How do I join?
There is no formal membership, just show up!  Everyone is welcome (assuming they stick to the few rules we do have!)
