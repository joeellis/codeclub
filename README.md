## What's Codeclub?

Codeclub is a new part of Nola Hack Night for those folks who would like learn more about topics they rarely have a chance to work with.  We pick a topic for the month, and, much like study group, we help each other learn a bit more of the topic at hand.

## How It Works
Each month, the members of Codeclub will pick a topic for dedicated study.  The topic may be a language, a framework, design concepts, really anything that fits under the following general guidelines:

* The topic should ideally be one that the members have have relatively little experience in working with, but have heard of before (Google's Go Language, Clojure, R, Meteor, etc.)
* The topic should be something that, if learned, would be generally useful to the members' profession.
* Highly dependent, but in general, the topic should be something that is open source, so all may easily take part in learning it.

## How Do We Pick New Topics
Before the month is out, we will make a VoteIt (www.voteit.com) vote to decide what the next topic of the month will be.  

Votes will last one week, contain no more than 10 options.  Please few the topic guidelines before adding an option.

The overall majority will rule this vote, with ties being settled by myself, Joe Ellis.  

Also, It is completely ok for next month's topic to be a repeat of the current month if that's what wins the vote.


## Where Is It?

Wherever we hold Nola Hack Night, which is currently at Launchpad on Tuesdays from 7pm to whenever.  Nola Hack Night will start at 7:30 to give folks time to arrive and  be held in the back conference room.


## The Culture
Codeclub, like any group, has a few rules we enforce in order to help shape the group's culture:

* Members should keep conversation to the topic at hand. *This is one of the main reasons the club exists.* There are many, many areas at Nola Hack Night to talk about other things, no need to do it at Codeclub.
* Members should feel free to ask and answer questions.  This should be a place to put your ego aside and just learn.  Don't look down on others because they may not know something you do. 
* Share what you learn.  There will be a space in this repo for a given month for folks to share learning resources, links, tips, etc. of the topic at hand.  Let's actively use that.
* In general, members should be nice or leave.  Codeclub should be a place of active learning, not a place of arguing.  If you want to argue, that's fine, and I hope you win;  but take it outside.

## FAQ

##### Are there any teachers for the given topic of the month?
No, we do not make specific plans to have teachers, so assume most of the time, your study should be self-guided.  However, it's a study group, so you should feel free to ask other people for help if you don't understand something.  

##### I know a lot about your monthly topic, can I come by and teach?
Yes, if you'd like to come by and help give us a head start, it will always be greatly appreciated!


##### What if I don't like the topic of the month?
Then you probably should not attend Codeclub meetings that month.  It's, of course, impossible to please everyone all the time, so instead of trying to do that, rotating the topic monthly should be frequent enough that eventually there should be a topic you'd be interested in.  I'd


##### Can I make suggestions for the group?
Sure can, just send a pull request to this README, and we'll start a conversation about your idea (if you don't know how to do this, contact me directly at joe@joeellis.la).  In general, decisions are done in a democratic process, so new ideas will be added assuming its what the group wants.


##### How do I join?
There is no formal membership, just show up!  Everyone is welcome (assuming they stick to the few rules we do have!)
